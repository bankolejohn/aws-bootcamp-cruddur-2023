## AWS CLI installed on gitpod successfully using the code below: 
##  curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install

## AWS CLI was also installed on my local machine successfully via the steps below:
Download and run the AWS CLI MSI installer for Windows (64-bit):

https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi
Alternatively, you can run the msiexec command to run the MSI installer.

msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi

To confirm the installation, open the Start menu, search for cmd to open a command prompt window, and at the command prompt use the aws --version command. 

aws --version
